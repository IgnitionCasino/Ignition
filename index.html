<p>It has been eight weeks since the suspension of the South America’s Champion’s League has been suspended.</p>



<p>The league had undergone just six weeks of group phase action. The suspension was due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Other leagues such as the European Football League and the Premier Soccer league have been affected as well.</p>



<p>Initially CONMEBOL hoped to restart the league on May 6 but that was not the case as the date came and passed.</p>



<p>What Are the Odds that theFractured Minds (ID@Xbox)- May 19</p>



<p><strong>League will Resume</strong></p>



<p>If the administrators do resume the league, they will have to make difficult decisions. The decisions include deciding what to do in order to complete the full calendar. They would have to switch to the shorter format in order to finish the league. If they do decide to move the league to next year then they would have encounter financial loses. Well if you get tired of waiting for the league you can play real money online casino games at <a href="https://www.casinojoka.com/fr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.casinojoka.com/fr</a> instead you will never be disappointed.</p>

<p>Every year the NBA draft is followed by millions of eager basketball fans around the world, as the most promising international and college prospects are chosen. The first picks typically go to the worst teams from the previous season, within a system that is aimed at making the NBA competitive. Nevertheless, it’s also a system with some glaring flaws, which includes encouraging teams to underperform and tank, in order to get better picks.</p>



<p>Perhaps the best example of a team tanking during the 2019-20 season is the Golden State Warriors. This is the same franchise which has dominated the NBA in recent years, reaching five consecutive NBA Finals since 2015 and winning the championship three times. Now they are completely unrecognizable, rock-bottom of the Western Conference and the first team to be mathematically eliminated from playoff contention.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aZ5n0pPX5wU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>The Milwaukee Bucks convincingly top the Eastern Conference and the Los Angeles Lakers dominate in the Western Conference, with both tipped as favorites to reach the Finals prior to the enforced break, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/US-Sports/NBA" target="_blank">according to the NBA betting on bet365</a>, yet casual observers are unable to understand why the Golden State Warriors aren’t up there competing with them. The answer is quite simple – the Warriors are tanking to ensure they get better draft options.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WlvU4XlGQy4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>In the world of competitive professional sports, it might be hard to comprehend a situation whereby losing can be regarded as ultimately more rewarding than winning. However, this is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://allthingsnba.news.blog/2019/03/23/the-nba-draft-lottery-paradox/" target="_blank">the paradox created by the NBA draft system</a>. The aim of the draft is noble, for sure, because it gives the worst teams each season a chance to improve.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it also creates a situation whereby franchises can exploit that noble aim. Since the introduction of the NBA draft Lottery, the odds are stacked heavily in favor of the worst teams for the first four picks. This means they will get the best new players entering the NBA. Ahead of the next NBA draft, the Golden State Warriors are the worst team in either conference, which means they have the joint-best odds of landing the highest-ranked players.</p>



<p>As this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1160424-golden-state-warriors-why-the-warriors-tanking-is-hurting-the-nba" target="_blank">2012 article published by Bleacher Report highlights</a>, it’s not the first time the Warriors have looked ahead to the draft, rather than focus on winning. Back then, the way they concluded the season was called into question, apparently valuing better draft options above the prestige of competing to finish higher in the league rankings. 2019-20 results have been so bad, it seems like the Warriors are taking the same approach to a new extreme.</p>



<p>In some regards, this has created a race to the bottom where GM’s value first picks in the draft, along with the chance to sign a potential All-Star player, ahead of team performance during a season that isn’t going so well. For this reason alone, it’s clear that the draft system needs to be constantly reviewed and revised.</p>



<p>Some have suggested a completely open lottery, with no preferential order amongst teams in the draft system based around conference positions from the previous season. Perhaps this approach would discourage teams from tanking, and restore the purity of competition to the NBA, with teams aiming to perform within the best of their capabilities; rather than keep one eye on what the next draft might offer instead. However, that could take away the parity across the league that the draft seeks to enforce, so there is no clear solution, but the current system is certainly flawed.</p>

<p>Although they are all a part of the gambling industry sports betting and online casinos have quite a notable number of differences.</p>



<p>However, online sports betting and online casinos have become the most popular ways that people are using to make real money online.</p>



<p>Due to this, there is always debate on which is the best one to work with when it comes to cashing in the big bucks.</p>



<p>With this in mind, here are some of the differences you should expect to find when betting with these online platforms.</p>



<p><strong>The Winning Odds</strong></p>



<p>According to a blog at <a href="https://www.cinemacasino.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="cinemacasino (opens in a new tab)">cinemacasino</a> sports betting and online casinos have a major difference when it comes to wagering and calculating your winning odds.</p>



<p>For instance, you have to use a sportsbook who have a fixed amount of money according to their requirements.</p>



<p>On the other hand, online casino games have random cash prizes. You can win $10000 from Mega Moolah while the next person wins millions.</p>



<p>Also, online casino wagering has what we call a house edge. Usually, this is what most online gamblers use to calculate their winning odds.</p>



<p>Contrary, sports bettors mainly use the probability technique to calculate their winning odds.</p>



<p>Also, bettors are forced to pay more money their intended wager due to the betting operational fees. </p>



<p><strong>Gambling Time Limits</strong></p>



<p>Unlike online casino games, sports betting is not always available for you anytime you need to make some real money online.</p>



<p>For example, if you are into soccer betting, you can only place a bet when there is a match or during the soccer league.</p>



<p>Whereas. Casino games are there for you to enjoy whenever you need them.</p>



<p><strong>Fun Betting Choices</strong></p>



<p>Online <a href="https://en.crazyvegas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="us casinos (opens in a new tab)">us casinos</a> have over a thousand slot games you can pick from. To make it even more fun, the games come with different cartoons, movies and contemporary comic book themes.</p>



<p>This is contrary to the monotonous nature of sports betting.</p>

<p>The current football season has witnessed some highs and lows. From the dressing rooms, the pitch and the dugout, the football world has witnessed some exceptional drama.</p>



<p>Goals galore, records have been broken, some spellbound moments with managerial changes coming into effect.</p>



<p>We have surely been part of a crazy rollercoaster of managerial changes across Europe. Most managers have been sacked due to some dismal performances from their teams.</p>



<p>According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ausportsbetting.org (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ausportsbetting.org/" target="_blank">ausportsbetting.org</a> one of the prime examples of a club that discards its managers is Watford. The Premier League side has sacked the likes of Javi Garcia and Quique Sanchez Flores this season after a poor run of results. </p>



<p>The two managers joined the list of high profile managers without a job currently.</p>



<p><strong>Unai Emery</strong></p>



<p>Ever since the Spaniard was shown the exit door by the Arsenal hierarchy. He has maintained a low profile without a job.</p>



<p>Unai Emery took over Arsenal after Arsene Wenger departed the club in the 2016-17 season. The seed of downfall for Unai Emery was sown in Baku during the Europa League Final against Chelsea. It was the last nail to the coffin.</p>



<p>This is when the Gunners lost 4-1 to their London rivals. Nevertheless, Arsenal started another season in underwhelming style. And the powers that be at Arsenal were very quick to send Unai Emery packing.</p>



<p><strong>Mauricio Pochettino</strong></p>



<p>Regarded as one of the best tacticians in the European elite. There is no doubt that Pochettino was all set to start a dynasty at Tottenham Hotspurs.</p>



<p>It came as a surprise when the world heard the news that Spurs have sacked Pochettino. After taking them to the UEFA Champions League Finals against Liverpool. Despite, Pochettino side punching above their weights hilariously, Spurs went on and sack the Spaniard.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the German giants Bayern Munich have eyed Mauricio Pochettino. Bayern Munich are looking for a long-term replacement for Hans-Dieter Flick who is currently in charge until the end of the season.</p>



<p>With all the crazy managerial changes that are taking place in the world of football. You can place your bets at your favourite <a href="https://www.bestusaonlinecasinos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="online casinos (opens in a new tab)">online casinos</a> or sportsbook on where these managers will end up coaching next season. </p>

	<p>The <strong>video replay</strong> one of the most discussed topic in <strong>football </strong>in the recent years.</p>
<p>Everyone expects from the referees to be perfect, or at least to reduce the mistakes during the games but it looks that this is a very hard task to do. So everyone tries to find solutions, and <em>Fifa </em>is pressed from all sides to come with an alternative.</p>
<p>In the first phase <em>Fifa </em>tried the system with 6 referees, tested it in Europa League, but even this solution doesn&#8217;t seem to be better. There were also speculations that the ball should contain a chip to signal when the ball passes the line of the goal but the solutions is not well seen by the specialists.</p>
<p>So at the moment it looks like the only viable solution is the video replay.Regarding the video replay the opinions are divided with a plus for it. Fifa is pressed to take a decision especially after the World Cup mistakes, when some of them proved to be crucial.</p>
<p>So after rugby, basketball, tennis or american football we might have video replays also in <strong>football</strong>. This decision would bring advantages but not only.</p>
<p>At advantages we can mention fewer mistakes that can decide games and  fewer scandals. On the other side the spirit and the charm of the game  would suffer.  Imagine for example a game show with a similar setup &#8211; a Who Wants To Be Millionaire Online Game for example would take so long and become boring. Also the game could have more than 10 minutes of  additional time which could determine the players to lose their  patience  awaiting for the verdict, the fluidity of the game could also  suffer.</p>
<p>The final decision will be taken in November but there are chances for a positive answer.</p>
